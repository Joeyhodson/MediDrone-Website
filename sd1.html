            <p style="line-height: 1.75;"> &emsp;The Divide & Conquer document marked the team's initial research and planning 
                stage, where they explored various project possibilities. After a lot of discussions, 
                the team decided to settle on developing a medical delivery drone. Although the drone underwent 
                several derivations throughout the course of the project, the core themes and ideas explored 
                during the initial research persisted until the final prototype. [ <a href="documents/MediDroneDnC.pdf" download><em>

            <p style="line-height: 1.75;"> &emsp;This document had undergone several iterations, each version including
                minor details that were excluded in the previous iteration. Designing a drone requires careful planning 
                and consideration, with numerous possible approaches to the task. This document includes mechanical designs, 
                electrical schematics, pseudocode, and various other technical resources. The team spent a significant amount of time
                and effort to determine the best design for their drone, and this document thoroughly outlines the continuous
                thought process. [ <a href="documents/MediDroneDesignPlan.pdf" download><em>download pdf</em></a> ]</p>
