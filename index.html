            <p style="line-height: 1.75;"><em>&emsp;&emsp;"MediDrone aims to accelerate supply transport between hospitals and other 
                medical centers. Without a binding operator to the aerial vehicle, other resources 
                can be freed to support a more efficient medical network. As Floridian students, 
                the team noticed the impact drones had in an instance like Hurricane Ian where 
                individuals were left without power, food, and water. Some individuals required 
                medical support urgently during this time of crisis. Drones have already been 
                integrated in modern society in many different forms of support, but in reality, 
                the future of drones has not even scratched the surface of their full potential."</em>

            <h2>Group 28</h2>
            <p style="line-height: 1.25;">&emsp;&emsp;During the semesters of Fall 2022 and Spring 2023, a group of interdisciplinary Senior Design
                Project members, Group 28, developed the MediDrone project at the University of Central Florida.
                The project involves various engineering practices, such as electrical, mechanical, and aerospace engineering,
                with the aim of designing a drone that can autonomously deliver a payload of medical supplies.
                The payload may include temperature-sensitive medications, small medical devices, or plant medicine, all of
                which are safely stored in multiple double-walled thermal insulation capsules called Chapie. The project's
                technical versatility is made possible by the collaboration between the electrical and mechanical teams, with the
                former designing the drone's power delivery, control, and communication components, and the latter designing its frame,
                motor mounts, and enclosures.</p>
